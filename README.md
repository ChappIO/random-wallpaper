# Random Wallpaper

I use this page to load a random wallpaper from unsplash periodically.

Usage: https://www.chapp.io/random-wallpaper?interval=time-in-minutes&terms=comma-separated-terms

For example: https://www.chapp.io/random-wallpaper?interval=10&terms=music,landscape,mood


Set a webpage as your wallpaper:
